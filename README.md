## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I gained a deeper understanding of the CSS border property.  I spent a lot of time working to create the blended background that was properly responsive.

### Continued development

I still have many "Newbie" challenges to complete on Frontend Mentor as I work toward a deeper understanding of front end fundamentals.
